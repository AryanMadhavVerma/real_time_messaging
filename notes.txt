Websockets solve the problem of fetching request from server by client being a one way direction. Client requests, and server responses. 
In real time applications, we always want to have links between server and client, and even when client doesnt requesta http request, server sends stuff. 
HTTP long polling still allows for servers. 

like we have http and https we have ws and wss

we wil use nodejs socket io which is javascript library to create chat apps, video callign apps etc/ It enable real time bidirectional event based communication 

event based communication means that for any click eg event, or a drag and drop event, we listen to events and handle them by providng somethign to do. inBrowser javascript can listen. 
Websocket can emit an event, and client can listen to it. This ensures two way communcaiton

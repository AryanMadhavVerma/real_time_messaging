# Real Time Messaging App
Created using NodeJS, Socket.io and Vanilla HTML,CSS and Javascript

### To run the app locally 
Clone the repository and run the command `npm install`
Run the `index.html` client file on a different port than the server. 
`cd` into the server and start the server's `index.js` file by running `npm start`. This will start the socket connection which the client will interact with.
